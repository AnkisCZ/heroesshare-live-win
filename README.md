Heroes Share Live client (Windows)

Heroes Share Live lets players view live game information and MMR previews for their games, or for anyone that uses the Heroes Share Live client.

How it works

Users need to install the Heroes Share Live client on their computer. The client watches for new games in progress and parses the replay file stubs to load game details. This happens in two stages:

BattleLobby: available at loading screen (after draft); includes players in the upcoming match, which can be used to fetch MMR Rejoin: available about one minute into the game; includes map, gamemode, heroes, and more extensive game details Once the files have been processed and uploaded anyone can visit the live games list to see game details, or use the latest game tracker to keep open match previews as new games load.

What goes on your computer

The client is very "thin" as most of the processing happens on our website. The code is all open source and can be reviewed on GitHub (macOS, Windows). Below is a summary of what each file does.
